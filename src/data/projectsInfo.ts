    description: `Rajshahi district was a part of the Pundra region of ancient Bengal ruled by the Pundra Kingdom. The capital of Prince Vijaya, the king who led military operations in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia was located 14 kilometres (9 mi) to the west of Rajshahi town. Rajshahi was dominated by various Maharajas, Rajas and Zamindars. During Deo Raja's period, the region was known as Mohakalgarh. In 1288-89 the Raja was defeated by Shah Makhdum Rupos. The region came to be known as "Rampur Boalia" after the establishment of an administrative office in 1825. The origin of the present name of "Rajshahi" is debated among scholars. However, Raj meaning the ruler and Shahi meaning the royal making Rajshahi the kingdom of royal ruler. The administrative district was established in 1772 and the municipal corporation in 1876. Rajshahi, located in north-western Bangladesh, is a city with a rich Islamic history, fascinating architecture, and vibrant culture. The city’s many mosques and Islamic landmarks reflect its long and complex history, while its unique culture and festivals showcase the diversity of Bangladesh. Amor Studio was given a chance to present a concept for the Central Eidgah of Rajshahi city named as Shah Makhdoom Eidgah.

    The project includes a 4 acre open field and two ponds. The field is to be converted to an Eidgah where people from all around the city would come to attend the two Eid Zamats. The place may be used for a gathering place for the city dwellers spending good time around it.
    
    One of the biggest challenges in the design process is to manage the traffic during the two Eid Zamats and ensure safety. Thousands of people would come within a short time before the Zamat and all would want to leave faster after the Zamat making it a complex flow of traffic all around the Eidgah.
    
    The proposed facility would include the Eidgah field with mosque, residence for the Imam, Muazzin and support staffs, a guest house, a library, a hall, equipment room, place for ozu, toilets, food court around the small pond and musical fountain at the large pond, adequate parking, lighting, sound system, security & safety equipment, etc.
    
    While designing the concept the existing architecture was taken in to consideration and similar structure is proposed.`
